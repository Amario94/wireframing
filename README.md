# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is a crucial step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating a simplified visual representation or blueprint of a digital product such as a website or mobile application.

## What is a Wireframe?
A wireframe is a low-fidelity layout that outlines the basic structure and elements of a page without focusing on visual design or content. It usually includes placeholders for images, buttons, navigation menus, and content blocks.

## Importance of Wireframing
Wireframing plays a vital role in the design process because it:

- Helps visualize the layout and functionality of a product early in development.
- Facilitates communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders.
- Identifies usability issues before the design is finalized.
- Saves time and resources by preventing costly changes later in the process.

## Conclusion
Wireframes are essential for planning intuitive and effective user experiences. Whether done with paper and pencil or using digital tools like Figma, Balsamiq, or Adobe XD, wireframing helps bring ideas to life before moving into full development.
